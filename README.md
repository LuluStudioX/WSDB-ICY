# V4 UPDATED

- Let's talk a little bit about V4
  - Scroll down to the bottom of the page to read the functions of the Menus
- First of all, those who will set up a discord bot for the first time can watch the youtube video by clicking [FULL HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwbOOij8wFY)
  
  - In version V4 we have 2 codes
1. Our code is /settings. As soon as you use this in the first installation, you will be set as the main administrator
2. Our code is /w command, this command is for ID Check

- In V4, python library installation, updates, etc. everything is automated
- We even have a system that checks for expired gift codes with hidden checks and deletes them from the database
- There are many features here that I cannot fully explain
  
  ##### REMEMBER USE PYTHON VERSION 3.12.4

# 👨‍💻 About the Developer

## Personal Introduction
I'm Umut, a 27-year-old developer specializing in Python and PHP. While I used to be an avid gamer, my responsibilities as a family provider have shifted my priorities, leaving limited time for gaming.

## 🤖 Bot's Journey
White of Survival bot started as a fun project for my own alliance. Upon realizing there wasn't anything similar available, I decided to develop it further and share it with the community. You're currently experiencing Version 4, following successful releases of V1, V2, and V3.

The development process has been intense, ranging from 1-2 hours some days to marathon 14-15 hour coding sessions.

## 💭 Why Free?
I'm often asked why I keep this bot free. The answer is simple: accessibility. If monetized, the user base would shrink from thousands to perhaps just 10-15 users. Having experienced financial constraints myself, I understand the importance of making useful tools available to everyone, regardless of their financial situation.

## 🤝 Support & Development
For those who can and wish to support the project, you can use the [☕ Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/reloisback) link. These contributions help cover development costs:
- Proxy servers
- Testing environments
- Server maintenance
- Development tools

## 💝 Final Words
To those unable to provide financial support - thank you for using the bot! Support has never been and will never be mandatory. This project will remain free forever.

I love this community and thank you all for being part of this journey. ❤️
